= Movement =
Arrow keys accelerate your ship.  As you get closer to the left and right edges, the screen pans to follow your ship's movement.

= Weapons =
The following weapons are operational:
== Standard weapons ==
These grow more powerful (and require more energy), as your ship gets more powerful.
  * `a` : ArcShot sends a set of plasma balls in a spreading pattern, to make dodging more difficult.  The number of plasma balls will increase as your ship is able to devote more power.
  * `s` : StraightShot fires a pair of powerful bolts that move quickly.
== Exotic weapons ==
  * `2` : GuardIan emits a smokescreen that absorbs some shots, and cause trouble to small ships.
  * `m` : MeteorMagnet pulls an asteroid toward your location.  Get out of the way!  The name is technically incorrect, but that's nothing compared to the next weapon:
  * `l` : LightNing is exactly what it sounds like.  A lot of fun.
